        Daniel is a very constructive person, who enjoys getting involved in different areas with assertive contributions and a lot of energy. He enjoys big challenges and being recognized for his contributions, sparing no effort to achieve goals. He also enjoys learning, relearning, collaborating, and sharing, enhancing other talents within the company. His good humor comes along with criticism regarding what can and should be improved, doing his part, seeking feedback, and asking for help with matters beyond his scope. Technically, he stood out in frontend work when we worked together, helping to shape other professionals who added a lot, and as a coordinator, he showed great organization, planning, and performance in complex projects, managing and caring for people, and providing good leadership within the team.

He was willing to help my professional growth from the beginning of our journey together, he was always available to help solve more complex problems and inspired me in the way he led with accurate questions and precise directions so that problems could be solved. This is because Daniel is a highly skilled professional in frontend stacks, with extensive knowledge of JavaScript. This knowledge, combined with the extensive experience he has as a leader and the calm and positive attitude he demonstrates, resulted in a very good experience on a daily basis. He was the best leader I ever had.
