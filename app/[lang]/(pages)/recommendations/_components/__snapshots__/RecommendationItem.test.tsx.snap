        I had the pleasure of working with Daniel Xavier at MEANING, and I can confidently say that he is an exceptional professional. Daniel stood out as a senior full-stack developer focused on front-end, with expertise in technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and JavaScript. His technical ability is always far ahead of other team members.
